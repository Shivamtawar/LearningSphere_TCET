// Email Verification Flow Test
// This file demonstrates how the email verification now works

/*
OLD FLOW:
1. User registers
2. User gets verification email with link like: 
   https://learningsphere-1fgj.onrender.com/api/auth/verify/abc123token
3. User clicks link
4. Browser shows JSON response: {"msg": "Email verified successfully"}
5. User stays on backend API URL - BAD UX!

NEW FLOW:
1. User registers  
2. User gets verification email with link like:
   https://learningsphere-1fgj.onrender.com/api/auth/verify/abc123token
3. User clicks link
4. Backend verifies email and redirects to:
   http://localhost:5173/?verification=success&message=Email%20verified%20successfully
5. Frontend Home page shows success notification
6. URL parameters are automatically cleaned up
7. User sees success message and can continue using the app - GOOD UX!

ERROR FLOW:
1. User clicks invalid/expired verification link
2. Backend redirects to:
   http://localhost:5173/?verification=error&message=Invalid%20token
3. Frontend shows error notification
4. URL parameters are cleaned up

console.log('Email verification now redirects users to the frontend home page!');
console.log('Make sure to set FRONTEND_URL in your .env file if different from http://localhost:5173');
